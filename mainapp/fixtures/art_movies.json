Based on some information he learns, Bucky believes that destiny is to become a porn star, despite he being a virgin and only having recently learned what masturbation is. With his parents' blessing, Bucky hops on a bus to Los Angeles to make it big there as a porn star. He is taken under the wings of a few people in LA. On the professional side, he meets the reigning king of porn, Dick Shadow, who only sees in Bucky a laughing stock. But washed up porn director Miles Deep stumbles across what he sees as an untapped niche market for Bucky's limited talents. Miles has the challenge of trying to convince investors who only see in Bucky the antithesis of porn. On the personal side, Bucky befriends a young diner waitress Kathy McGee, who helps Bucky find a place to live - albeit with an insensitive oaf named Gary who only wants to get into Kathy's pants - and navigate general life in the big city. Kathy, however, is facing her own demons in working toward her destiny, those demons which Bucky hopes he can help her beat down.",

His life changes when he meets Dorothy Stratten working behind the counter of a Dairy Queen. Dorothy is a pretty but naive high school senior. Paul immediately falls for Dorothy, who sees in Paul a wise, worldly person unlike herself. Paul believes Dorothy is Playboy material, the magazine he sees as only a springboard to bigger and better things. Paul's dream does become a reality: not only does Dorothy eventually marry him, she becomes the August 1979 Playboy Playmate and ultimately Playboy Playmate of 1979, which does indeed lead to the start of an acting career. As Dorothy's star rises, Paul's life is one of a hanger-on as those in Dorothy's new circle, including Playboy publisher Hugh M. Hefner and movie director Aram Nicholas, don't much like Paul. Paul is unable to eke out a life of his own without using Dorothy's name, which she increasingly is reluctant to provide to her husband. Those that know the couple know their relationship cannot continue as is, and it's only a matter of how it will change or end is the question.",

We watch the two women in particular: Satara sings with emotion and includes dance in her final performance, an action that puts her life in danger; Lema is traditional, but her very appearance brings death threats. The three finalists are from different tribes, and each makes a plea for Afghan unity. The camera visits families watching the competition, there are comments from people in the street, and we return home with a nervous Setara. In Afghanistan, singing is an expression of freedom.",

To secure this unique picture a Biograph camera was kept constantly at work by specially devised electric apparatus for weeks, during which time exposures were made every four minutes, 8 hours a day. Before the contractors began their work of tearing down and after the last vestige of the building had been removed, 15 seconds of exposure at normal speed were made. Thus in the finished positive one views at first the old Star Theatre standing as it had for years looking down with serenity upon the bustle of Broadway traffic. Then as if struck by a tornado of supernatural strength, the building begins to crumble. Chimneys totters, walls cave in, and whole stories vanish, until at last the site shows only a cellar excavation; and the Broadway cars with the sidewalk procession continue as if nothing unusual had happened. When this view is shown in the reverse, the effect is very extraordinary.",

Riding through the dark desert on horseback, they see a flashing star off in the distance, which they ride over to investigate.

Nick has no Christmas spirit, especially as he deals with the problems of customers, this despite his wife Rosa serving all their customers with a smile and warm heart.

As such, he does not want to extend his lobby as shelter for a drifter who just wants to come in from the cold for a little while. Although the drifter tries to explain the true meaning of Christmas to Nick, Nick watching the interactions of all those around him may be a better way to show him, especially when a young and obviously in distress young couple named José and Maria Santos arrive, with no more rooms available at the inn.",

        "description": "Four People. One Horoscope. Infinite Possibilities. Jake Gibson's (Cam Gigandet) horoscope forecasts a perfect FIVE STAR DAY the morning of his birthday, but what's foretold as a flawless day unfolds to be far less than stellar. Jake's world turns upside down when all that could go wrong ... does. Determined that Astrology has no legitimacy, Jake embarks on a journey to test the theory of Astrology by finding the three people born the same time and place as himself - Sarah Reynolds (Jena Malone), Yvette Montgomery (Brooklyn Sudano) and Wesley Henderson (Max Hartman). The journey quickly uproots Jake from the small college town of Berkeley, California, to downtown Chicago where he sets out to find and interview Sarah, Yvette and Wesley to see if their birthdays proved to be as deplorable as his own. Jake's pursuit in finding his three Astrological matches (or Zodiac twins) will not only test his convictions, but validate how life's unexpected twists of fate can deliver much more than the anticipated. The unforeseen takes Jake from the Windy City, to the boardwalk of New Jersey's Atlantic City, to the bustling streets of New York. What Jake learns along the way is an important lesson about life, love, fate and destiny that will unexpectedly change his life forever.",

Earth's space fleet is hopelessly outclassed by the Gamilas and all seems lost... until a mysterious space probe is retrieved on Mars. The probe contains blueprints, and a message from Queen Starsha of the planet Iscandar, who claims to have a device which can cleanse Earth of its radiation damage. The blueprints are of a supercraft that can enable any ship to head to Iscandar (situated in another galaxy) and back in a year, and with these plans the denizens of Earth secretly rebuild a Japanese battleship, the Yamato, into a great space battleship. A large intrepid crew of 999 departs for Iscandar in the Yamato to require the device... but with the menace of the Gamilas, can they succeed in time?",

But when the lights came up, they all disappeared... Unless you had all the toys. In which case, the adventure never had to end. In backyards, playgrounds, basements, and bedrooms, Star Wars toys helped kids re-enact scenes from their favorite movies, and create entirely new dangers for Luke Skywalker and his friends to face. They were lusted after on holidays and birthdays, swapped with great cunning out on the school yard, and carefully collected like fine treasures. Like no toys before them, the action figures, space ships, play sets, and props were a phenomenon that swept the nation with as much force as the film that inspired them. Along the way they transformed both the toy and movie industries, earned those behind them vast amounts of wealth, and ultimately created a hobby that, 30 years later, still holds sway over not only the people who grew up with the toys, but also an entirely new generation of fans. Plastic Galaxy is a documentary that explores the groundbreaking and breathtaking world of Star Wars toys. Through interviews with former Kenner employees, experts, authors, and collectors, it looks at the toys' history, their influence, and the fond and fervent feelings they elicit today.",

The latest incident in the feud is an on-field brawl between the players worse than they have ever had, which results in an indefinite suspension of both teams from the league pending a full investigation. Each game not played results in a loss and thus less and less chance of either team reaching the post-schedule championship. Beyond the direct measures to have the league lift Invicta's suspension, its owner/president, José Carlos Silva, believes another indirect measure is to win in the court of public opinion by currying favor with Philip Andrews, a British documentarian filming a movie about the feud, and whose cameras and stories he hopes will document that Invicta is the innocent victim. To curry that favor, José, upon Philip's expression of interest, is pushing his innocent daughter, Inês Silva, to date Philip, in who she truly has no interest despite Philip being a decent man. Meanwhile, one Castelo player not involved in that on-field incident is Brit Paul Collins, who was out sick that game and who is nursing a broken heart over a recent break-up with his girlfriend, Danielle. However, Paul and Inês fall in love at first sight when they spot each other across a crowded room at a party. Despite the obstacles, Paul and Inês do clandestinely see each other, with Carla, Inês' paternal grandmother, and Dr. Lawrence, Paul's American physician, reluctantly being their co-conspirators, reluctant in that they are more cognizant about a Paul/Inês relationship being fraught with life long problems. As Paul and Inês' love deepens, so does the feud, the two which truly may be incompatible.",

Falco, a loyal friend of Fox, decided to leave the team in search of new challenges. Peppy, in his old age, quit his duties as a pilot to focus on navigation, and Slippy did likewise, focusing on his technological developments. While Fox and his comrades are recognized as heroes, they've received little in the way of work since Andross's death, and their ship, the Great Fox, has seen much better days. However, one day, as they're approaching Dinosaur Planet at the edge of the Lylat System, they receive a message from General Pepper asking Fox to investigate what's caused the world to suddenly start breaking up and find a way to fix it. At the same time, Dinosaur Planet's inhabitants are under the dictatorial rule of General Scales, whom Fox must contend with in order to complete his mission. And then there's the mysterious Krystal, who became trapped in a large crystal after being attacked within Krazoa Palace. Can Fox free her and receive her help to stop General Scales and save Dinosaur Planet?",

Driving the stars of low-budget movies, along with their fragile egos, to and from locations in the middle of nowhere, pushes Don's buttons in all of the wrong directions. When Luke, the young and self-absorbed writer/director challenges Don's authority, murder and mayhem ensues. The movie's Scream Queen' starlet, Riversa Red, to her dismay finds herself the target of Don's obsession. With his encyclopedic knowledge of her \"body\" and body of work, Don worms his way onto Riversa's good side, no easy task. Not knowing whether to fear or friend Don, Riversa finds herself at the center of a cyclone with Luke and Don both vying for her attention. A mysterious Hotel Bellboy and an unknown \"watcher in the woods\" lend themselves to the growing suspense as the cast and crew hold-up at Forest Grove Lodge. After a couple of grueling days into the movie shoot, Don goes berserk, getting himself kicked off of the show. But letting go of Don doesn't come without a price. When he shows up the next day, 9 mm handgun in tow, the cast and crew are forced to act in Don's own home movie. Those who make a stand are dealt a deadly hand and those that await their fate wish they never stepped into the \"Star Vehicle\". Once the wheels of horror start rolling, there's no turning back.",

She proudly marches over to the luxury hotel in the center of town and immediately begins to change the personnel. Because this involves the facilities belonging to a joint-stock company, which no one can inherit, she is considered insane. It comes out that her inheritance is in reality a small, shabby little hotel of the same name in the IV town district. The personnel are three unemployed youths who in this way work off the money they owe for rent. The first guest is wealthy Vladimír Rychta Rohan (Oldrich Nový), whose parents spent their honeymoon in this very hotel. He wants to celebrate his wedding there, with which his fiancée Milada (Adina Mandlová), who is waiting for him at the luxurious Blue Star, does not concur.",

Borg Invasion 4D ran from 2004 to 2008. The audience enters a small theater where physically present actors portraying the Star Fleet crew greet them. The story is told through prerecorded 3D film sequences and actors' interaction with them and the audience. The story takes place some time after the end of the ST: Voyager series. The audience takes the roll of guests on a secret space station where Doctor from Voyager works with researches on creating a new DNA strain that will be resistant to the Borg's assimilation techniques. The guests are there to have themselves tested and help the research in case their DNA contains the resistant strain. Then the Borg attack. Actors lead the audience through a couple of hallways as other actors dressed as the Borg assimilate the researchers. Finally, the audience and the \"surviving\" actors reach another small theater that represents an escape shuttle and there a new series of prerecorded 3D film sequences starts. The shuttle launches but the Borg cube with the Queen inside captures it. As the Queen taunts the audience, the Borg are tearing the shuttle apart. Just as they are about to reach the audience, a familiar, charmingly raspy, friendly female voice is heard as well as the sound of proton torpedoes. She disagrees that resistance is futile and is there to prove it.",

At 57 minutes, the film takes a very significant look at an under appreciated aspect of the porn industry - names. How did Ron Jeremy become known as 'The Hedgehog'? Fluffy Cumsalot, Porn Star examines this and goes further by asking legitimate porn stars how they came up with their current stage names and what their names would be if they had used the formula - your first pet and the name of the street that you grew up on. What results are some truly amazing and interesting stories intertwined with footage from movies , interviews and public appearances.",

A planet from another solar system drifts into Earth's system and is detected by some Earth scientists who investigate. The surface of this planet is no longer habitable and the residents have moved to a high-tech underground city. The society is ruled by the women, who of course, are all beautiful. Men are considered mentally inferior and are divided into two categories: the \"adequately intelligent\" who are selected by women to act as their personal \"domestics\" for household chores, and the remainder who are forced to perform menial labor under the supervision of female guards. The guards are attired nicely in visored helmets, boots, hot pants, and elbow-length gloves which are used to control the men through some sort of apparent force. Scientists from Earth (one men and one woman) find their way to the planet, and are forced to take their stated places in society. The man is chosen as a domestic, sometimes is forced to work on a city maintenance crew, and the woman is assigned a white-collar job. The aliens also visit Earth clandestinely in their tear-drop shaped ship. Some episodes bluntly address the issue of unfair discrimination based on sex.",

        "title": "Joan Crawford: Always the Star",
        "description": "This glamorous and hugely popular actress raised herself from brutal poverty to Academy Award-winning stardom by guts, determination and hard work. During her fifty-year career, she made over eighty films. But her obsessive perfectionism led to the later caricature of coat-hanger-wielding harridan that even the adoration of fans could not counter. Still, she has endured as one of the most popular icons of the movies, an early role model to a million young women who aspired to her image of stylish magnetic power and unquestioned independence. She was born Lucille LeSueur on March 23, 1904 (or 1906) in San Antonio, Texas. Her father soon disappeared and she took the name of her stepfather, calling herself Billie Cassin. When Cassin, too, vanished, Billie did menial work to help her mother and brother survive. Ill-paid sales jobs bought dancing lessons and the clothes she needed to enter amateur contests. Then came a night-club contract as chorus girl - $25-a-week and eight routines a night. And so she made it into show-business, but the humiliations and insecurities of those early years would never entirely leave her. Spotted by an MGM scout, by 1925 she was under contract in Hollywood. She made the usual publicity appearaces and did Exhibition Dancing at night. Her vitality, charm and dancing talents earned her many admirers - including some powerful enough to advance her career, like William Haines, Paul Bern, Jackie Coogan, Sr. and Louis B. Mayer. After bit parts and a small role in the film Pretty Ladies, a studio-sponsored competition found her the name she at first hated: Joan Crawford. As Crawford's acting skills developed, she became known for her independence and her resilience despite some less-than-successful roles. Her vaguely pretty and plump early looks were soon replaced by the svelte, hard-boiled beauty of hollow-cheeks, thick brows and overpainted mouth that would be her permanent image. Her capacity to inspire and wear with flair the creations of the dress designer Adrian was legendary. But most of all, she was known for her hard work on the set. Joan Crawford's personal life was characterized equally by self-discipline and the determination to better herself, banishing forever her unhappy beginnings. Four husbands included actors Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, Franchot Tone, Phillip Terry and businessman Alfred Steele. Plagued by innumerable miscarriages, she adopted four children, one of whose account of Joan's unyielding perfectionism has succeded in blurring memories of the remarkable life and career of a Hollywood immortal. Among Joan Crawford's films from which clips are included: Sally, Irene and Mary, 1925; Our Dancing Daughters, 1928; Grand Hotel, 1932; Dancing Lady, 1933; The Gorgeous Hussy, 1936; The Women, 1939; A Woman's Face, 1941; Mildred Pierce, 1945; Humoresque, 1946; Possessed, 1947; Sudden Fear, 1952; Johnny Guitar, 1954 Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? 1962 and Strait Jacket, 1964.",

In the four years that follow there is no question that rapping has brought Priscilla closer to her estranged father, and that her success has made him proud. Before our eyes, this father-daughter duo go from a one-bedroom shelter in Harlem to a 4 bedroom apartment, from food stamps to shopping sprees, from rapping on street corners to sold out night clubs, and from sneaking under train turnstiles without the $2 fare to spare to being driven around in tinted SUV's. It is further undeniable that Jesse has been reborn, from looking at old photos and bitterly reflecting on how he never was given the respect he deserved in the music business as a rapper himself to finding his own voice and self-respect as his daughter's overzealous manager. But in the efforts to make her dad proud, Priscilla struggles to remain a child and finds herself trapped in a world of people twice her size and four times her age and doesn't know who to trust. Jesse himself is caught between wanting to protect his daughter' innocence and exploiting her raw talent to fulfill his deferred dream. All they know is that the ride has just begun.",

Throughout his career at the film studio in St. Petersburg, Klushantsev pioneered and invented legendary techniques for filming the planets, stars and weightnessless - long before anyone else. He went on to redefine the science fiction genre and influence the way Hollywood made their science fiction films, including the Academy Award-winning Visual Effects Master, Robert Skotak, a man who spent years trying to track Klushantsev down. This is a film about a fantastic inventor and dreamer whose destiny was intimately linked with the Space Race and the whims of the Soviet dictatorship. However, despite dying blind and penniless, Klushantsev has left an indelible mark on the history of film and inspired countless filmmakers.

Jyn: The Rebel: A closer look at the film's main protagonist: personality, character history and what separates her from other protagonists from the Star Wars universe, physical preparations for the shoot, and more. Cassian: The Spy: Much the same as the previous supplement in terms of introducing the character and his history, the qualities the character brings to the story, and casting Diego Luna. K-2SO: The Droid: A look at the robotic character: his \"anti C-3PO personality,\" character design, Alan Tudyk's motion capture performance, and the humor the actor brought to the set. Baze and Chirrut: Guardians of the Whills: The actors discuss landing and accepting the roles, the characters' camaraderie, individual character details, faith and the force in the movie and the Star Wars universe, and the actors' physical performances. Bodhi and Saw: The Pilot and The Revolutionary: The piece begins with Riz Ahmed's auditions and crafting the character, the character's fate, and making key sequences. It moves on to examine Forest Whitaker's character and his history in the Star Wars universe, character definition and history, Whitaker's preparations for the role, and more. The Empire: A run through of key Imperial characters, including Galen Erso, Orson Krennic, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Darth Vader and the qualities (and in Vader's case, the presence) their actors brought to their roles. Visions of Hope: The Look of Rogue One: Designing a world that's true and familiar to the Star Wars universe but still unique to the film. It explores set construction, small design changes, and the black stormtroopers. The Princess and The Governor: Digitally recreating two important characters. Epilogue: The Story Continues (1080p, 4:15): Images from the film's premiere juxtaposed against fans talking up the film and the franchise. The piece ends with a selection of clips from the film.",

He stops to watch a group of newsboys singing and dancing, and decides to organize them into the greatest kid act to ever hit vaudeville. Mary persuades Proctor, a big theatrical manager, to book the act, and they are a big hit. Then Larry and his publicity agent, \"Speed\" King, launch a big publicity stunt---a talent train in which they travel across country holding auditions for young performers. Back in New York, Carlotta Salvini, an ex-OPera singer, brings in her talented fourteen-year-old-daughter, Jane, who has an amazing voice. Larry, to get the mother out of the way, offers Carlotta a forty-week vaudeville tour, and then goes to work to make a star out of Jane, by building Braodway's first all-kiddie musical revue around her. Opening night has \"School Days\" as the first act and the show and Jane are a big hit...until the Gerry Society, organized to protect working children, reminds Larry there is a law against children working after 10 p m., and the show closes. Larry's future appears dim at best.",

Its claim to fame is that it is the star of the MGM feature film The Yellow Rolls-Royce (1964). For filming, the automobile traveled from London to northern Italy (Pisa and Florence) to Austria to Yugoslavia, along the way encountering its several co-stars including Rex Harrison and Jeanne Moreau in London, Shirley MacLaine, George C. Scott, Art Carney and Alain Delon in Italy, and Ingrid Bergman and Omar Sharif in Austria and Yugoslavia. The limo also encountered many fans interested both in the filming and the vehicle itself. During filming, the limo was well taken care of by a large maintenance crew. In its post filming life, the limousine has even inspired a fashionable clothing line by designer Joan Leslie in, of course, the famous yellow motif.",

Gilead Church on Buckingham Mountain, Ben and Moses get to experience life as free men and cross paths with historical figures such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Joshua and Jonathan Fell.

        "description": "Cuba, in the 50th year of the Revolution. While the Castro brothers face their certain end, an uncertain future hangs over the island. Some people are afraid, many cannot wait, but all shudder and hope that the changes will be positive. This documentary leads the audience through the discovery of this hope, through a tourist's camera which looks to be turned off and oblivious to the conversation at hand, yet is focused on candidly capturing each person's wishes. There is the old guerrillero who took part in the revolution, the lady who met Che Guevara and lives thanks to the government social card, and also the young boys and girls - those who wish to make a career within the rules, as well as those who only try to escape abroad. Clandestine underground shops, businessmen experienced in all things illegal, dodgy pimps, mothers who force their daughters into selling their bodies - the hidden face of the State which welcomes tourists into its luxury resorts is openly displayed beyond censorship's control. One special guide is Yoani Sanchez, the independent blogger, a leader of the new, peaceful revolution - the revolution of ideas. The internet is its main instrument, while the government attempts to limit computer use with any means possible in a pushing and pulling of ideals. In the interview, recorded in a secret location, the young writer speaks about her country's ruin, and where Raul's reforms have no effect on everyday life. Castro's supporters and dissidents, young and old - none deceive themselves that the star of the revolution will shine on for much longer. And this is what this project focuses on: the wishes on a falling star.",

He claimed to be from Mars, so Xiao Bo brought him home in order to teach him a thing or two about life on Earth. Dubbed \"ET\" by his human hosts, the curious alien soon reveals that he has been sent to this planet in order to learn as much as possible about physical interaction.

        "description": "Some of the vaudeville manager's \"star acts\" had failed to make good, others were still detained abroad. The manager called his press agent in, scolded him and ordered him to secure a vaudeville team, adding that \"they must be extremely funny and extremely cheap.\" Within a short time the agent returned and proudly announced he had found \"an absolute novelty, and a joint salary of $15.\" \"I dodged all the agencies,\" he explained, \"and down on one of the side streets I ran across an old-time ham actor. I followed him. He went into a laundry and tried to get his duds out without paying for them. Well, the woman who ran the joint was a regular comedy queen. She didn't say much, but she certainly was full of 'pep.' She nearly wrecked the laundry with that actor, and I never laughed so much in my life. When I offered them an engagement the man balked, but the woman accepted for both of them, saying he could work out his laundry bill anyhow.\" The manager tried the act out, and it made a big hit. The morning papers gave much space to the \"Soap Suds Star,\" Sophie, the laundress. Much to his dismay, however, the press agent found the manager in an extremely bad humor. \"It's all your fault,\" he said bitterly, \"You get me to hire amateurs, and now they are going to be married, and quit vaudeville for the classics.\" \"I think it a dandy idea,\" said the agent. \"Sophie as Juliet would coin money for any manager. Why not try them out in the balcony scene\" The manager, impressed, retained his \"Soap Suds Star,\" and his leading man. Sophie s bad temper, however, spoiled her artistic career. She was on the job as Juliet, all right, but Romeo nearly missed the performance, and when he did appear he wore his street clothes, explaining with an alcoholic smile that he had been out with the boys and really had no time to dress. Sophie left her art to chastise him, but after a lively chase he escaped by leaping into the river, and the one-time actress returned to her laundry, believing she was a widow. But her husband came back and Sophie forgave him. Then, finding that his clothes had been well sprinkled in the river, she ironed him out, and gave him a life position in the laundry.",
