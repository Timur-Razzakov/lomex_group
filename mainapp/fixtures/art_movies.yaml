    The Brawne's eldest daughter, Fanny Brawne, and Mr. Brown don't like each other.
    She thinks he's arrogant and rude, and he feels that she is pretentious, knowing
    only how to sew (admittedly well as she makes all her own fashionable clothes),
    flirt and give opinions on subjects about which she knows nothing. Insecure struggling
    poet John Keats comes to live with his friend, Mr. Brown. Miss Brawne and Mr.
    Keats have a mutual attraction to each other, a relationship which however is
    slow to develop in part since Mr. Brown does whatever he can to keep the two apart.
    But other obstacles face the couple, including their eventual overwhelming passion
    for each other clouding their view of what the other does, Mr. Keats' struggling
    career which offers him little in the way of monetary security (which will lead
    to Mrs. Brawne not giving consent for them to marry), and health issues which

  plot: Living in small town Iowa, Bucky Larson is a simple minded, uneducated, beaver
    toothed young man still living with his protective parents, Jeremiah and Debbie
    Larson. Initially saddened when he is fired from his job as a bagger at a supermarket,
    he eventually sees it as a sign that he is destined for greatness in some other
    field. Based on some information he learns, Bucky believes that destiny is to
    become a porn star, despite he being a virgin and only having recently learned
    what masturbation is. With his parents' blessing, Bucky hops on a bus to Los Angeles
    to make it big there as a porn star. He is taken under the wings of a few people
    in LA. On the professional side, he meets the reigning king of porn, Dick Shadow,
    who only sees in Bucky a laughing stock. But washed up porn director Miles Deep
    stumbles across what he sees as an untapped niche market for Bucky's limited talents.
    Miles has the challenge of trying to convince investors who only see in Bucky
    the antithesis of porn. On the personal side, Bucky befriends a young diner waitress
    Kathy McGee, who helps Bucky find a place to live - albeit with an insensitive
    oaf named Gary who only wants to get into Kathy's pants - and navigate general
    life in the big city. Kathy, however, is facing her own demons in working toward
    her destiny, those demons which Bucky hopes he can help her beat down.

    envy by thoughtlessly wishing at a 'shooting star' (comet) to be Alexia. To their
    stupor, that happens the next morning. Forced to live each-other's lives, but
    unable to do it well by the other's standards, the sisters soon hate each-other
    even more and deliberately screw up. Gradually, they realize they would only both
    lose out, learn to appreciate the other's values and reconsider their own. Remain

  plot: This film shows the demolition of the historic Star Theatre building (formerly
    Wallack's) at the corner of Broadway and 13th Street, New York. To secure this
    unique picture a Biograph camera was kept constantly at work by specially devised
    electric apparatus for weeks, during which time exposures were made every four
    minutes, 8 hours a day. Before the contractors began their work of tearing down
    and after the last vestige of the building had been removed, 15 seconds of exposure
    at normal speed were made. Thus in the finished positive one views at first the
    old Star Theatre standing as it had for years looking down with serenity upon
    the bustle of Broadway traffic. Then as if struck by a tornado of supernatural
    strength, the building begins to crumble. Chimneys totters, walls cave in, and
    whole stories vanish, until at last the site shows only a cellar excavation; and
    the Broadway cars with the sidewalk procession continue as if nothing unusual
    had happened. When this view is shown in the reverse, the effect is very extraordinary.

  plot: When Star Wars landed in the theaters, it introduced audiences to a galaxy
    filled with heroes and villains, robots and space ships, and a dizzying variety
    of alien life. But when the lights came up, they all disappeared... Unless you
    had all the toys. In which case, the adventure never had to end. In backyards,
    playgrounds, basements, and bedrooms, Star Wars toys helped kids re-enact scenes
    from their favorite movies, and create entirely new dangers for Luke Skywalker
    and his friends to face. They were lusted after on holidays and birthdays, swapped
    with great cunning out on the school yard, and carefully collected like fine treasures.
    Like no toys before them, the action figures, space ships, play sets, and props
    were a phenomenon that swept the nation with as much force as the film that inspired
    them. Along the way they transformed both the toy and movie industries, earned
    those behind them vast amounts of wealth, and ultimately created a hobby that,
    30 years later, still holds sway over not only the people who grew up with the
    toys, but also an entirely new generation of fans. Plastic Galaxy is a documentary
    that explores the groundbreaking and breathtaking world of Star Wars toys. Through
    interviews with former Kenner employees, experts, authors, and collectors, it
    looks at the toys' history, their influence, and the fond and fervent feelings
    they elicit today.

    the studio to put him in a western parody, not telling him what they're really
    planing, because they know that he does not like comedies. Rather than ending
    tragic-comically, the movie becomes a brilliant coda to art and its servants,
    the artists, in this case the magniloquent Joan Blondell and Stuart Erwin.

  plot: Bob the Tomato and Larry the Cucumber appear as Cavis Appythart and Millward
    Phelps, respectively--two jingle writers based loosely on Gilbert and Sullivan.
    The setting is 1880s London, and they've written a musical called "The Princess
    and the Plumber", which they plan to open on Christmas Eve. Cavis thinks the production
    will "teach London how to love". But children at nearby St. Bart's Church are
    planning a nativity play for the same evening, and they plan to feature the Star
    of Christmas, a religious artifact unseen by the public for decades. The London
    Post Gazette writes a front-page story about the nativity play and the Star, and
    Cavis and Millward hatch a plan to make their musical better than the children's
    play. In the end, they learn about the true meaning of Christmas.

  plot: It has been eight years since Fox McCloud defeated the evil Andross. Since
    then, the Star Fox team has been on a slow downturn. Falco, a loyal friend of
    Fox, decided to leave the team in search of new challenges. Peppy, in his old
    age, quit his duties as a pilot to focus on navigation, and Slippy did likewise,
    focusing on his technological developments. While Fox and his comrades are recognized
    as heroes, they've received little in the way of work since Andross's death, and
    their ship, the Great Fox, has seen much better days. However, one day, as they're
    approaching Dinosaur Planet at the edge of the Lylat System, they receive a message
    from General Pepper asking Fox to investigate what's caused the world to suddenly
    start breaking up and find a way to fix it. At the same time, Dinosaur Planet's
    inhabitants are under the dictatorial rule of General Scales, whom Fox must contend
    with in order to complete his mission. And then there's the mysterious Krystal,
    who became trapped in a large crystal after being attacked within Krazoa Palace.
    Can Fox free her and receive her help to stop General Scales and save Dinosaur
    Planet?

  plot: '"Star Vehicle" follows the downward spiral of movie driver Donald Cardini,
    a self-professed movie buff with a penchant for explosive violence when provoked.
    Driving the stars of low-budget movies, along with their fragile egos, to and
    from locations in the middle of nowhere, pushes Don''s buttons in all of the wrong
    directions. When Luke, the young and self-absorbed writer/director challenges
    Don''s authority, murder and mayhem ensues. The movie''s Scream Queen'' starlet,
    Riversa Red, to her dismay finds herself the target of Don''s obsession. With
    his encyclopedic knowledge of her "body" and body of work, Don worms his way onto
    Riversa''s good side, no easy task. Not knowing whether to fear or friend Don,
    Riversa finds herself at the center of a cyclone with Luke and Don both vying
    for her attention. A mysterious Hotel Bellboy and an unknown "watcher in the woods"
    lend themselves to the growing suspense as the cast and crew hold-up at Forest
    Grove Lodge. After a couple of grueling days into the movie shoot, Don goes berserk,
    getting himself kicked off of the show. But letting go of Don doesn''t come without
    a price. When he shows up the next day, 9 mm handgun in tow, the cast and crew
    are forced to act in Don''s own home movie. Those who make a stand are dealt a
    deadly hand and those that await their fate wish they never stepped into the "Star
    Vehicle". Once the wheels of horror start rolling, there''s no turning back.'

    4D was a Star Trek: Voyager-based attraction, part of the Star Trek: The Experience
    series of attractions at the Las Vegas Hilton in Paradise, Nevada. Borg Invasion
    4D ran from 2004 to 2008. The audience enters a small theater where physically
    present actors portraying the Star Fleet crew greet them. The story is told through
    prerecorded 3D film sequences and actors'' interaction with them and the audience.
    The story takes place some time after the end of the ST: Voyager series. The audience
    takes the roll of guests on a secret space station where Doctor from Voyager works
    with researches on creating a new DNA strain that will be resistant to the Borg''s
    assimilation techniques. The guests are there to have themselves tested and help
    the research in case their DNA contains the resistant strain. Then the Borg attack.
    Actors lead the audience through a couple of hallways as other actors dressed
    as the Borg assimilate the researchers. Finally, the audience and the "surviving"
    actors reach another small theater that represents an escape shuttle and there
    a new series of prerecorded 3D film sequences starts. The shuttle launches but
    the Borg cube with the Queen inside captures it. As the Queen taunts the audience,
    the Borg are tearing the shuttle apart. Just as they are about to reach the audience,
    a familiar, charmingly raspy, friendly female voice is heard as well as the sound
    of proton torpedoes. She disagrees that resistance is futile and is there to prove
    it.'

  plot: Fluffy Cumsalot, Porn Star is an extraordinary documentary about porn stars
    and their stage names. Featuring Ron Jeremy, Marilyn Chambers, Jenna Jameson,
    Seymore Butts and over 70 more of the world's top porn stars, this film is a fascinating
    and revealing documentary about adult performers and the origin of their on-screen
    names. At 57 minutes, the film takes a very significant look at an under appreciated
    aspect of the porn industry - names. How did Ron Jeremy become known as 'The Hedgehog'?
    Fluffy Cumsalot, Porn Star examines this and goes further by asking legitimate
    porn stars how they came up with their current stage names and what their names
    would be if they had used the formula - your first pet and the name of the street
    that you grew up on. What results are some truly amazing and interesting stories
    intertwined with footage from movies , interviews and public appearances.

  plot: 'TV series of British/German origin, and set in the "present" Earth of the
    1970s. A planet from another solar system drifts into Earth''s system and is detected
    by some Earth scientists who investigate. The surface of this planet is no longer
    habitable and the residents have moved to a high-tech underground city. The society
    is ruled by the women, who of course, are all beautiful. Men are considered mentally
    inferior and are divided into two categories: the "adequately intelligent" who
    are selected by women to act as their personal "domestics" for household chores,
    and the remainder who are forced to perform menial labor under the supervision
    of female guards. The guards are attired nicely in visored helmets, boots, hot
    pants, and elbow-length gloves which are used to control the men through some
    sort of apparent force. Scientists from Earth (one men and one woman) find their
    way to the planet, and are forced to take their stated places in society. The
    man is chosen as a domestic, sometimes is forced to work on a city maintenance
    crew, and the woman is assigned a white-collar job. The aliens also visit Earth
    clandestinely in their tear-drop shaped ship. Some episodes bluntly address the
    issue of unfair discrimination based on sex.'

  plot: 'This glamorous and hugely popular actress raised herself from brutal poverty
    to Academy Award-winning stardom by guts, determination and hard work. During
    her fifty-year career, she made over eighty films. But her obsessive perfectionism
    led to the later caricature of coat-hanger-wielding harridan that even the adoration
    of fans could not counter. Still, she has endured as one of the most popular icons
    of the movies, an early role model to a million young women who aspired to her
    image of stylish magnetic power and unquestioned independence. She was born Lucille
    LeSueur on March 23, 1904 (or 1906) in San Antonio, Texas. Her father soon disappeared
    and she took the name of her stepfather, calling herself Billie Cassin. When Cassin,
    too, vanished, Billie did menial work to help her mother and brother survive.
    Ill-paid sales jobs bought dancing lessons and the clothes she needed to enter
    amateur contests. Then came a night-club contract as chorus girl - $25-a-week
    and eight routines a night. And so she made it into show-business, but the humiliations
    and insecurities of those early years would never entirely leave her. Spotted
    by an MGM scout, by 1925 she was under contract in Hollywood. She made the usual
    publicity appearaces and did Exhibition Dancing at night. Her vitality, charm
    and dancing talents earned her many admirers - including some powerful enough
    to advance her career, like William Haines, Paul Bern, Jackie Coogan, Sr. and
    Louis B. Mayer. After bit parts and a small role in the film Pretty Ladies, a
    studio-sponsored competition found her the name she at first hated: Joan Crawford.
    As Crawford''s acting skills developed, she became known for her independence
    and her resilience despite some less-than-successful roles. Her vaguely pretty
    and plump early looks were soon replaced by the svelte, hard-boiled beauty of
    hollow-cheeks, thick brows and overpainted mouth that would be her permanent image.
    Her capacity to inspire and wear with flair the creations of the dress designer
    Adrian was legendary. But most of all, she was known for her hard work on the
    set. Joan Crawford''s personal life was characterized equally by self-discipline
    and the determination to better herself, banishing forever her unhappy beginnings.
    Four husbands included actors Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, Franchot Tone, Phillip Terry
    and businessman Alfred Steele. Plagued by innumerable miscarriages, she adopted
    four children, one of whose account of Joan''s unyielding perfectionism has succeded
    in blurring memories of the remarkable life and career of a Hollywood immortal.
    Among Joan Crawford''s films from which clips are included: Sally, Irene and Mary,
    1925; Our Dancing Daughters, 1928; Grand Hotel, 1932; Dancing Lady, 1933; The
    Gorgeous Hussy, 1936; The Women, 1939; A Woman''s Face, 1941; Mildred Pierce,
    1945; Humoresque, 1946; Possessed, 1947; Sudden Fear, 1952; Johnny Guitar, 1954

    talent and undeniable charisma, he begins to teach her all he knows about rapping.
    In the four years that follow there is no question that rapping has brought Priscilla
    closer to her estranged father, and that her success has made him proud. Before
    our eyes, this father-daughter duo go from a one-bedroom shelter in Harlem to
    a 4 bedroom apartment, from food stamps to shopping sprees, from rapping on street
    corners to sold out night clubs, and from sneaking under train turnstiles without
    the $2 fare to spare to being driven around in tinted SUV''s. It is further undeniable
    that Jesse has been reborn, from looking at old photos and bitterly reflecting
    on how he never was given the respect he deserved in the music business as a rapper
    himself to finding his own voice and self-respect as his daughter''s overzealous
    manager. But in the efforts to make her dad proud, Priscilla struggles to remain
    a child and finds herself trapped in a world of people twice her size and four
    times her age and doesn''t know who to trust. Jesse himself is caught between
    wanting to protect his daughter'' innocence and exploiting her raw talent to fulfill
    his deferred dream. All they know is that the ride has just begun.'

  plot: About a visual wizard and a fantastic legacy of films which transformed and
    influenced the science fiction genre as we know it. The Russian filmmaker, Pavel
    Klusjantsev, has had an extraordinary influence on an entire genre of films. Throughout
    his career at the film studio in St. Petersburg, Klushantsev pioneered and invented
    legendary techniques for filming the planets, stars and weightnessless - long
    before anyone else. He went on to redefine the science fiction genre and influence
    the way Hollywood made their science fiction films, including the Academy Award-winning
    Visual Effects Master, Robert Skotak, a man who spent years trying to track Klushantsev
    down. This is a film about a fantastic inventor and dreamer whose destiny was
    intimately linked with the Space Race and the whims of the Soviet dictatorship.
    However, despite dying blind and penniless, Klushantsev has left an indelible
    mark on the history of film and inspired countless filmmakers. The Star Dreamer
    ensures that the name of Pavel Klushantsev lives on.

  plot: At a 1965 international auto show in New York City, the key attraction is
    not a new car but a 35 year old late 1930s-vintage brilliant yellow colored Phantom
    II Rolls-Royce limousine. Its claim to fame is that it is the star of the MGM
    feature film The Yellow Rolls-Royce (1964). For filming, the automobile traveled
    from London to northern Italy (Pisa and Florence) to Austria to Yugoslavia, along
    the way encountering its several co-stars including Rex Harrison and Jeanne Moreau
    in London, Shirley MacLaine, George C. Scott, Art Carney and Alain Delon in Italy,
    and Ingrid Bergman and Omar Sharif in Austria and Yugoslavia. The limo also encountered
    many fans interested both in the filming and the vehicle itself. During filming,
    the limo was well taken care of by a large maintenance crew. In its post filming
    life, the limousine has even inspired a fashionable clothing line by designer
    Joan Leslie in, of course, the famous yellow motif.

    less money, and mediocrity holds sway. Yet there are more bands than ever before
    working for years just to receive even the tiniest drop of success. Following
    the lives and careers of Tub Ring, Bloodshoteye, and 3 Mile Scream, with supporting
    interviews from major players in the heavy music scene, this documentary sheds
    light on why some bands never make it and why the ones that break realize only
    too soon that life on a label is only the beginning of their troubles.

    Is That You? (1976), co-starring Pearl Bailey, Michael Warren, Dennis Dugan and
    Tamara Dobson. The movie is produced and directed by George Schlatter. The movie
    tells the story of a man, played by Foxx, whose wife has run off with his brother
    and who as a result goes to visit his only son, Norman, played by Warren, in Los
    Angeles for some sympathy, but receives something else entirely. The making of
    this family-centric storied movie is very much as a family, as Foxx, Bailey and
    Schlatter have been friends for years and treat each other as family.

  plot: The North Star is the story of Benjamin "Big Ben" Jones and Moses Hopkins,
    two slaves who escaped from a Virginia plantation and made their way to freedom
    in Buckingham, Pennsylvania in 1849. Big Ben's 6 foot 10 inch size and a record
    bounty for his safe return make him the focus of every slave hunter on the east
    coast. Their journey exposes them to danger and cruelty; however it also exposes
    them to the unexpected kindness of the people involved in the Underground Railroad.
    These experiences will change Ben and Moses forever. Upon reaching the relative
    safety of Mt. Gilead Church on Buckingham Mountain, Ben and Moses get to experience
    life as free men and cross paths with historical figures such as Frederick Douglass,
    Harriet Tubman, Joshua and Jonathan Fell. Their freedom also allows them to experience
    heroism, romance and treachery.

  plot: 'Cuba, in the 50th year of the Revolution. While the Castro brothers face
    their certain end, an uncertain future hangs over the island. Some people are
    afraid, many cannot wait, but all shudder and hope that the changes will be positive.
    This documentary leads the audience through the discovery of this hope, through
    a tourist''s camera which looks to be turned off and oblivious to the conversation
    at hand, yet is focused on candidly capturing each person''s wishes. There is
    the old guerrillero who took part in the revolution, the lady who met Che Guevara
    and lives thanks to the government social card, and also the young boys and girls
    - those who wish to make a career within the rules, as well as those who only
    try to escape abroad. Clandestine underground shops, businessmen experienced in
    all things illegal, dodgy pimps, mothers who force their daughters into selling
    their bodies - the hidden face of the State which welcomes tourists into its luxury
    resorts is openly displayed beyond censorship''s control. One special guide is
    Yoani Sanchez, the independent blogger, a leader of the new, peaceful revolution
    - the revolution of ideas. The internet is its main instrument, while the government
    attempts to limit computer use with any means possible in a pushing and pulling
    of ideals. In the interview, recorded in a secret location, the young writer speaks
    about her country''s ruin, and where Raul''s reforms have no effect on everyday
    life. Castro''s supporters and dissidents, young and old - none deceive themselves
    that the star of the revolution will shine on for much longer. And this is what
    this project focuses on: the wishes on a falling star.'

    a tender lesson in earthly love after being taken in by a curious bisexual. When
    Xiao Bo first saw the curious alien, he was alone and naked on a long stretch
    of highway. He claimed to be from Mars, so Xiao Bo brought him home in order to
    teach him a thing or two about life on Earth. Dubbed "ET" by his human hosts,
    the curious alien soon reveals that he has been sent to this planet in order to
    learn as much as possible about physical interaction. Bisexual Xiao Bo has both
    a girlfriend and a boyfriend, neither of whom are particularly thrilled that Xiao
    Bo has brought home a new lover. Later, when Xiao Bo's girlfriend attempts to
    have a child with "ET," the alien falls into a deep coma. Now the way to revive
    "ET" is for Xiao Bo to utter the words "I love you." Once that happens, Xiao Bo
    resolves to teach his extraterrestrial friend the true meaning of Earthly Love
    before "ET" travels back to his home planet to reveal his passionate findings.

  plot: Direct from Brazil in his last recorded performance, Antonio Carlos Jobim
    (1927-1994) is joined by an international delegation of jazz giants to recreate
    his classic melodies in a beautiful, concert-length "Thank You." With over four
    hundred songs to his credit, including the unforgettable "Girl From Ipanema,"
    Jobim virtually singlehandedly brought the world the Bossa Nova. Adapting the
    percussive excitement of the Samba to the intimacy of the guitar while echoing
    the melodies and harmonies of Cool Jazz, Jobim's new sound quickly became a staple
    ingredient in the jazz cookbook, and in 1991 Jobim was inducted into the Songwriter's
    Hall of Fame.

  plot: Some of the vaudeville manager's "star acts" had failed to make good, others
    were still detained abroad. The manager called his press agent in, scolded him
    and ordered him to secure a vaudeville team, adding that "they must be extremely
    funny and extremely cheap." Within a short time the agent returned and proudly
    announced he had found "an absolute novelty, and a joint salary of $15." "I dodged
    all the agencies," he explained, "and down on one of the side streets I ran across
    an old-time ham actor. I followed him. He went into a laundry and tried to get
    his duds out without paying for them. Well, the woman who ran the joint was a
    regular comedy queen. She didn't say much, but she certainly was full of 'pep.'
    She nearly wrecked the laundry with that actor, and I never laughed so much in
    my life. When I offered them an engagement the man balked, but the woman accepted
    for both of them, saying he could work out his laundry bill anyhow." The manager
    tried the act out, and it made a big hit. The morning papers gave much space to
    the "Soap Suds Star," Sophie, the laundress. Much to his dismay, however, the
    press agent found the manager in an extremely bad humor. "It's all your fault,"
    he said bitterly, "You get me to hire amateurs, and now they are going to be married,
    and quit vaudeville for the classics." "I think it a dandy idea," said the agent.
    "Sophie as Juliet would coin money for any manager. Why not try them out in the
    balcony scene" The manager, impressed, retained his "Soap Suds Star," and his
    leading man. Sophie s bad temper, however, spoiled her artistic career. She was
    on the job as Juliet, all right, but Romeo nearly missed the performance, and
    when he did appear he wore his street clothes, explaining with an alcoholic smile
    that he had been out with the boys and really had no time to dress. Sophie left
    her art to chastise him, but after a lively chase he escaped by leaping into the
    river, and the one-time actress returned to her laundry, believing she was a widow.
    But her husband came back and Sophie forgave him. Then, finding that his clothes
    had been well sprinkled in the river, she ironed him out, and gave him a life
    position in the laundry.
